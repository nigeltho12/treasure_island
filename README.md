# treasure_island

This project is very short mini game inspired by one those old school books where you could choose your own adventure. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the road to be greeted with all that Treasure Island has to offer but be wary the road to greatness can be treacherous if you're not careful! Good Luck and Have fun! Feel free to try the game again and change up your choices along the way.
